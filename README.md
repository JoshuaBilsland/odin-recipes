# odin-recipes
Project for www.theodinproject.com (Foundations/HTML Foundations)

This project is for the HTML Foundations for the Foundations course. The website will have an index page which includes links to different recipes.

## Things I have learnt and shown in this project:
- File structuring for website files
- What a HTML boilerplate is and how to write one
- How to use different sized headings in HTML - `<h1>` - `<h6>`
